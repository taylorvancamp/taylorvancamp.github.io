                <div id="box1" class="col-sm-2 text-light">(Road) (Marty spots a sign for the neighborhood that he lives in. It's just about to be built.) Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. (stops a car that's driving by) Woah, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. (They quickly drive off.)

                <div id="box2" class="col-sm-4 text-light">C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. (kisses George's head.) Woo, time to change that oil. (George laughs at that.) Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

                <div id="box3" class="col-sm-2 text-dark">(Just then, a Rolls Royce appears, exiting a private street. Needles' truck almost hits it, and he spins around the vehicle just in time.) Geez...I would've hit that Rolls Royce. (As he stares, puzzled, Jennifer takes out the Cusco FAX she brought home from the future earlier and watches as the text, "YOU'RE FIRED!!!", vanishes from the page.) (in an awed whisper) It erased. (Train Tracks)

(Blacksmith Shop) (Marty arrives in town. He jumps off his horse and runs into Doc's shop.)Emmett! (Marty is keeping his eye on the speedometer and talking to himself.) Come on, come on. (He suddenly screams into the walkie-talkie.) You better hold on to something, Doc, the yellow log's about to blow!!! (There is a big explosion and Clara is shown, stunned, as she was thrown back a little on the car she was climbing on.) Ahh! Golly.</p>

               <p class="text-warning bg-primary">No, no, no, no, no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids! (The DeLorean) (Inside Marty and Jennifer are seated in the passenger seat while Doc is driving.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.</p>

               <p class="text-primary bg-warning">(to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. (Bedroom) (Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.) Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p class="text-warning bg-primary">(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.</p>

She's hanging upside down.) Whoa!! Emmett! Clara! Hold on! I can't! (She screams in desperation as her dress begins to rip.)

They're in the middle of their conversation.) ...4 cans of Valvoline. 4 cans for a $300 job? I can't even have lunch… I should be getting a case or more out of you for a 300 buck job.

(Marty looks up out the window which is on the other side of the room. Tannen is outside, yelling into the saloon.) It's eight o'clock, and I'm calling you out. (yelling out to Tannen) It's not 8:00 yet! It is by my watch! Let's settle this once and for all, runt. Or ain't you got the guts?
